					One Piece is the bestselling manga in history; its popularity is through the roof. Readers of all demographics and genders love the story. Even non-manga fans follow One Piece with cult-like enthusiasm.
					One Piece offers simple, yet enjoyable art, endearing characters, and a balance of action and adventure. There’s heavy development of all the characters, including the extras. Each chapter is a page-turner.

					<li> <h2><b>Dragon Ball (Akira Toriyama, 1984 – 1995)</b></h2>
					The Dragon balls are seven golden balls that have the ability to grant a wish. They summon Shenron, the wish dragon. Teenage girl Bulma is on a quest to find them all. Accompanied by a monkey-tailed boy named Son Goku, they go on adventures around the world.
					Goku undergoes a relentless training regimen under the legendary Master Roshi. His goal is to fight in the Tenkaichi Budokai Martial Arts Tournament. As Goku gets stronger, more evil comes his way. Eventually, he and his friends must save the earth from invaders from outer space.
					Dragon Ball is one of the most, if not the most, beloved manga of all time. Still read decades after its run, it’s the most influential manga of all time.

					<li><h2><b>Monster (Naoki Urasawa, 1994 – 2001)</b></h2>
					Dr. Kenzo Tenma is a benevolent doctor and brain surgeon. He’s tired of the political bias towards certain classes of people in the hospital where he works.
					In the wake of a massacre, he tries to change how things work. He takes care of fraternal twins Anna and Johan. Johan has a gunshot wound to his head. The bullet was meant for the mayor of the town. Johan is saved but the mayor dies.
					Tenma is vilified by his co-workers. They wanted him to save the mayor before saving the young, low-status Johan. Everyone who antagonizes Dr. Tenma in the hospital gets murdered one by one, and the kids are nowhere to be found.
					The Police think he’s the killer, but they have no evidence. Who is the cold-blooded killer?
					Who is this… monster?
					Monster is masterful suspense thriller that keeps you guessing. The manga is a top shelf crime-suspense experience. Every scene is a glut of misinformation. You can never tell what might happen next.
					The art is cinematic and calculated. Every stroke of the brush is meticulous, and the expressions are never exaggerated. Each page is perfection itself. The character’s expressions show each emotion subtly, without overdoing it.
					Scenic perfection: These two words describe Monster’s art better than any other phrase could.</li>

					His fate changes once their team fights Nosferatu Zodd. Zodd defeats both him and Griffith. Zodd warns Guts his friendship with Griffith will be the source of his death. But will it?
					Berserk is a dark fantasy action adventure manga. It’s acclaimed for the action-filled frames and the unrelenting story of sadness and war.
					It explores the concepts of hate and crushing despair. The reader sympathizes with the characters, however contemptuous they may be.
					Berserk is not your usual manga. Reading the story makes you feel like a wrecking ball just crashed straight into your heart.</li>
