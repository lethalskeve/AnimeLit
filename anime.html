					<li> <h2><b>"Mob Psycho 100 II</b></h2>
					<b>Release date:</b> January 7<br>
					<b>Director:</b> Yuzuru Tachikawa<br>
					<b>Animation production:</b> Bones<br>
					Coming hot on the tail of the series' 
					breakout debut in 2016, Mob Psycho 100 II carries the torch of its predecessor's pedigree
					as one of the most hilarious, kinetic, and aesthetically eclectic anime to air in recent
					memory, pushing that envelope even further in its second season. With most, if not all, of 
					the original staff from the first season returning for this outing, including animator Miya 
					Sato, whose masterful "oil on glass" animation has distinguished so many of the previous season's 
					stand-out sequences, the adventures of layabout con artist Reigen Arataka, his formidably powerful
					protege, Shigeo "Mob" Kageyama, and their poltergeist sidekick, Dimple, continue to ramp up as Mob
					journeys through adolescence in the face of ever-more perilous stakes. Aside from its adventurous 
					animation, whip-sharp comedic timing, and impressive action sequences, Mob Psycho 100 II is a touching 
					coming-of-age story of the relationship between a mentor and his pupil, and how the two help each to grow 
					into more mature, earnest, and better-adjusted individuals. Come from the pyrotechnics, stay for the waterworks.

					<li><h2><b>Sarazanmai</b></h2>
					<b>Release date:</b>April 6 <br>
					<b>Director:</b> Nobuyuki Takeuchi, Kunihiko Ikuhara<br>
					<b>Animation production:</b> MAPPA, Lapin Track <br>
					Let's cut straight to the point: Sarazanmai is one of, if not the most bizarre, 
					idiosyncratic, visually audacious, and thematically evocative anime to air in 2019.
					Describing just exactly what the hell Saranzanmai is to someone who has never seen an 
					anime directed by Kunihiko Ikuhara (Revolutionary Girl Utena, Pengiundrum, Yurikuma Arashi)
					is about as difficult as it would be to describe the concept of 'water' and what the hell 
					it means for something to be 'wet' to an alien. But, put simply, the show follows three middle-schoolers -- Kazuki Yasaka,
					Kuji Toi, and Enta Jinnai -- as they are transformed into kappa, amphibious beak-faced demons, after releasing Keppi,
					the guardian spirit of Asakusa, from the statue containing him and accidentally insulting him. To return to human form,
					the three are tasked with exorcising "kappa-zombies," malicious poltergeists, by performing elaborate dance numbers in a liminal dimension to steal the zombies’
					shirikodama, magical spheres representing human desire, by forcibly removing them from their anuses. That is the tamest, most perfunctory description of what Sarazanmai 
					is about, and it only gets stranger from here on out. Ikuhara is known for writing shows with socially-conscious premises powered by avant-garde visuals laden with 
					labyrinthine levels of subtextual depth, and Sarazanmai is no different. Even knowing that, nothing can quite prepare you for the surprises this show has to offer. 
					If nothing else, know this: It is one of the most daring, earnest, and empathetic series to air this year, and save for having watched one of Ikuhara's works in the past,
					you won’t see anything else quite like it. </li>

					<li> <h2><b>The Promised Neverland</b></h2>
					<b>Release date:</b> January 11<br>
					<b>Director:</b> Mamoru Kanbe<br>
					<b>Animation production:</b> CloverWorks<br>
					The Promised Neverland follows 11-year-old Emma and her best friends, Norman and Ray, three of 37 orphaned children who live
					on a mysterious walled estate called the Grace Field House. Under the watchful eye of their caretaker known simply as Mom, 
					the children are afforded the best that life can offer. Gourmet meals, plush beds, immaculate white outfits, and ample play
					time while they wait to one day be adopted by a loving family. However, the quiet idyllicism of Grace Field is swiftly shattered 
					when Emma and Co. stumble upon a dark secret which underlies the House’s very existence. Horrified by their discovery, the three
					conspire to escape with the rest of children into the outside world, as the machinations of both their caretaker and Grace Field’s 
					mysterious benefactors move steadily to completion. With a premise that sounds like a cross between From The New World and Kazuo 
					Ishiguro’s novel Never Let Me Go, The Promised Neverland is an engrossing fantasy thriller with deft animation, savvy editing,
					and a taut atmosphere of mortal horror juxtaposed against a disquietingly cheerful exterior.</li>

					<li><h2><b>Dororo</b></h2>
					<b>Release date:</b> January 7<br>
					<b>Director:</b> Kazuhiro Furuhashi<br>
					<b>Animation production:</b> MAPPA, Tezuka Productions<br>
					In the midst of a terrible plague at the height of Japan’s Warring States period, 
					Lord Daigo Kagemitsu of the Ishikawa province enacts a pact with 12 demons in order
					save his region and secure a path to a future of wealth and power. In exchange, each
					of the demons collect on Kagemitsu’s debt by taking body parts from his newly born son
					-- his limbs, his eyes, his tongue, his skin -- until the baby is rendered into a horrifying 
					testament to his father’s sins. Years later, the boy, having survived his father’s attempt to
					dispose of him out of shame, grows up to become an itinerant swordsman named Hyakkimaru with a 
					prosthetic body, swords for arms, and the extrasensory ability to "see" demons. Adapted from Ozamu 
					Tezuka’s original manga and anime from the late ‘60s, Dororo tells the story of Hyakkimaru’s quest 
					to slay demons, regain his humanity, and learn to love and open up to other people in a time of immense
					cruelty with the help of his companion, an orphaned thief by the name of Dororo. Produced by Studio Mappa
					(Kids on the Slope, Yuri on Ice, Banana Fish) and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi (Rurouni Kenshin, Hunter
					× Hunter '99, and Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn), Dororo is an anime as viscerally violent as it is heartbreaking,
					and a series that should not be missed.</li>

					<img src="image/love.jpg">
					<li><h2><b>Kaguya-sama: Love is War</b></h2>
					<b>Release date:</b> January 12	<br>	
					<b>Director:</b> Mamoru Hatakeyama <br>
					<b>Animation production:</b> A-1 Pictures <br>
					In the “contest” of romance, the person who falls in love first -- or “catches feelings”
					as the kids say nowadays -- is the loser. Or at least, that’s the premise of A-1 Pictures’
					Kaguya-Sama: Love Is War. Adapted from the popular ongoing manga of the same name, Love Is 
					War follows the story of Miyuki Shirogane and Kaguya Shinomiya, two genius-level students 
					attending the illustrious Shuch’in Academy, who quietly harbor feelings for one another.
					So far, so boring. But there’s a twist: Due to an ill-fated combination of entrenched class consciousness,
					emotional immaturity, and toxic adolescent pride, neither Shirogane or Shinomiya will acknowledge their feelings 
					for the other. Rather than healthily process these emotions and talk things out like, y’know, adults, Shirogane
					and Shinomiya instead elect to orchestrate an elaborate series of public situations to force the other to confess
					their feelings first in a bid to save face. The result is a romantic comedy infused with the intensity of a psychological 
					thriller that’s equal parts hilarious and infuriating for all the right reasons.</li>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<img src="image/demon.jpg">
					<li> <h2><b>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</b></h2>
					<b>Release date:</b> April 9 <br>
					<b>Director:</b> Haruo Sotozaki <br>
					<b>Animation production:</b> Ufotable <br>
					Adapted from Koyoharu Gotōge’s ongoing Shonen Jump manga series, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba follows Tanjiro Kamado,
					a young charcoal merchant turned demon slayer, as he sets out on a journey of discovery and revenge to not only avenge
					his family’s grisly murder, but to find a cure for his younger sister Nezuko, who survived their family’s attack only 
					to be transformed into a feral half-demon with an aversion to sunlight. Ufotable is perhaps best known for their work 
					on the Fate franchise, a byzantine dark fantasy series renowned for its dazzling fight sequences and digital animation; 
					fortunately, those qualities carry over to Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. While the show might not be as thematically-nuanced 
					or poignant as, say, Dororo, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is an impressive shonen adventure series in its own right and
					is sure to appeal to any fan of Naruto or Black Clover and stands as one of the most well-animated fantasy chanbara series 
					to come out this year.</li>

					<img src="image/pop.jpg">
					<li><h2><b> Boogiepop and Others</b></h2>
					<b>Release date:</b> January 4<br>
					<b>Director:</b> Shingo Natsume<br>
					<b>Animation production:</b> Madhouse<br>
					The latest anime adaptation of Kouhei Kadono's influential early aughts light novel series,
					Boogiepop and Others, is an anthology swirling around Boogiepop, a vigilante alter-ego of
					high schooler Touka Miyashita that possesses her body in moments of mortal crisis in the
					fight against a cadre of otherworldly creatures with ties to a shadowy entity known only 
					as the Towa organization. As a series, Boogiepop and Others could be best described as a 
					slow-burn supernatural mystery thriller dotted with adrenaline-spiking sequences of horror, 
					action, and suspense set against a backdrop of stunning metropolitan vistas. As an adaptation 
					of not only the first novel in Kadono's series, but several of the series' other celebrated 
					entries such as Boogiepop at Dawn, Boogiepop Returns: VS Imaginator, and Boogiepop Overdrive:</li>
